-- ROLLBACK for drizzle/0088_epoch_name_snapshot.sql — MANUAL ONLY, NEVER RUN AUTOMATICALLY.
-- Not a drizzle migration: drizzle-kit only runs files listed in drizzle/meta/_journal.json.
--
-- Order: revert the code first (it reads member_a_name / member_b_name), then
-- run this. The reverse also works because the columns stay, but code-first
-- avoids a window where new code reads NULL names (it falls back to the live
-- name, i.e. the pre-0088 behaviour).
--
-- What it does:
--   1. drops the snapshot trigger and its function;
--   2. sets BOTH snapshot columns to NULL. They are derived data (re-running
--      0088's backfill recreates them, with today's names). Without this step,
--      an account deleted after the rollback would keep its real name in the
--      columns, because the restored body below no longer scrubs them;
--   3. restores process_account_deletions to the 0086 body (no GroupEpochs
--      name scrub). Valid only while 0088 is the latest migration defining
--      the function: a later one that redefines it (e.g. #1618) must restore
--      0088's body in its own rollback.
-- NOT dropped: the columns (old code ignores them).
