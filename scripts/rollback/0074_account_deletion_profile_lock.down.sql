-- ROLLBACK for drizzle/0074_account_deletion_profile_lock.sql — DEV ONLY, NEVER RUN AUTOMATICALLY.
-- Not a drizzle migration: drizzle-kit only runs files listed in drizzle/meta/_journal.json.
--
-- Roll back the app code FIRST. lib/db/queries/epoch.ts (lockProfileRow) calls
-- public.profile_is_live; once this drops it, every createGroup and
-- acceptInvite fails with "function public.profile_is_live(uuid) does not
-- exist", which reaches the user as a generic error.
--
-- What it does:
--   1. Restores process_account_deletions to 0071's definition (copied
--      verbatim below, byte for byte from drizzle/0071_account_deletion_rescan.sql),
--      with its REVOKE/GRANT lines. This brings back #1449: an acceptInvite or
--      createGroup committing after the job's re-read leaves the deleted user
--      as a tombstone in a ledger.
--   2. Drops public.profile_is_live(uuid).
--   3. Removes 0074's row from drizzle.__drizzle_migrations so `db:migrate`
--      would re-apply it.
--
-- Run inside one transaction:  psql "$DATABASE_URL" -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -1 -f <this file>
